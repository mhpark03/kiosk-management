# HashRouter Fix for S3 Deployment

## Problem Solved

The 404 error when accessing routes like `/profile` on S3 has been fixed!

## What Was Changed

### Root Cause
S3 Static Website Hosting with `BrowserRouter` returns 404 status codes for routes, even though it serves the correct content via ErrorDocument. This can cause issues in some browsers.

### Solution Applied
**Switched from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter`** in `src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
// Before
import { BrowserRouter as Router, ... } from 'react-router-dom';

// After
import { HashRouter as Router, ... } from 'react-router-dom';
```

## How It Works Now

### URL Format Changed
URLs now use hash-based routing:

- **Before**: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/profile`
- **After**: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/profile`

### Routes
All routes now have `#/` prefix:

- Home: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/`
- Login: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/login`
- Dashboard: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/dashboard`
- Profile: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/profile`
- Kiosk Management: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/kiosk`
- Store Management: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/store`
- History: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/history`
- Batch Management: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/batch`

## Deployment Status

✅ **Build Completed**: New version with HashRouter built successfully
✅ **Uploaded to S3**: All files uploaded with no-cache headers
✅ **Verified**: New JS bundle (index-C5kkR6Vt.js) is being served

## Testing

Try accessing the app now:

1. **Root URL**: http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/

2. **Direct Route Access** (this should now work without 404):
   ```
   http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/#/profile
   ```

3. **After Login**: Navigate through the app - all routes should work correctly

## Important Notes

### ✅ Advantages
- No 404 errors on direct route access
- Works perfectly with S3 Static Website Hosting
- No CloudFront needed
- All routes return 200 status codes

### ⚠️ Trade-offs
- URLs have `#/` in them (e.g., `/#/profile` instead of `/profile`)
- Hash in URL visible to users
- Search engines may not index routes optimally (but this is an admin app, so likely not an issue)

## Alternative: CloudFront (Optional)

If you prefer clean URLs without `#`, you can set up CloudFront:

1. Keep `BrowserRouter` (revert the change)
2. Set up CloudFront distribution pointing to S3
3. Configure Custom Error Responses to redirect 403/404 to `/index.html` with 200 status

This is more complex but provides cleaner URLs. Let me know if you want to go this route!

## Backend Configuration

Backend is already configured correctly:
- ✅ CORS allows S3 URL: `http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com`
- ✅ API URL: `http://Kiosk-backend-env.eba-32jx2nbm.ap-northeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api`
- ✅ Backend health check: OK

## Summary

The app should now work perfectly! Clear your browser cache if needed and try accessing:
```
http://kiosk-frontend-20251018.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/
```

All navigation should work without any 404 errors.
